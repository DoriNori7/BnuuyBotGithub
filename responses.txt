##TAG USAGE:
##
##Use Anywhere:
##  {a} - always send this (never gets removed by random chance or by another {only} response). Also makes a response immune to typos.
##  {only} - same function as {a}, but also removes all other nonessential responses
##  {nodel} - disable auto deletion of message
##  {deleteorig} - deletes original message (will not respond if it lacks the permission to delete messages)
##  {fast} - causes the response message to disappear much faster (5 seconds vs the usual 15)
##  {vfast} - causes the response message to disappear much much faster (1 second)
##  {rare} - makes the key/response have a 50% chance to not trigger/send - Note: takes precedent over {a} and {only}
##  {vrare} - same as {rare}, but now the chance is 10% - Note: Can be combined with {rare} to make the total probability 5%
##
##Use in keywords only:
##  {noimg} - will ignore the keyword if it is parsed from an image
##  {jeff} - keyword will only activate for jeff (hardcoded)
##  {alone} - ensures the keyword is not part of another larger word
##  {gokuattempt} - counts the use of the keyword as a goku attempt
##  {emote} - equivalent to {a}{noimg}{nodel}
##
##Use in responses only:
##  {break} - breaks the response into separate messages (use as many times as you want in a single response)
##  {goku} - awards the sender with a single goku point
##  {lead} - attempts to parse the text before the keyword. Will replace the key with this text. (Will not respond on parsing failure)
##  {trail} - attempts to parse the text after the keyword. Will replace the key with this text. (Will not respond on parsing failure)
##  {lead1} - similar to {lead}, but will only include the first word/letters adjacent to the keyword
##  {trail1} - same as {lead1}, but for the {trail} tag
##  {react}{XXX} - adds an emoji reaction to the original message. (Replace "XXX" with the emoji) (This is not robust - will throw error if improperly formatted) (maximum reactions is 20, but this is fairly arbitrary)
##  {random} - picks a random word from the text
##  {author} - fills in the author's nickname or username
##  {atauthor} - fills in a ping for the author
##  {time} - fills in the current time (ET timezone)
##  {date} - fills in the current date (ET timezone)
##  {weekday} - fills in the current day of the week (ET timezone)

##Note: Most punctuation is cleaned before parsing, so keywords should not contain punctuation
